Features
========

## 1. Seamless synchronization of labels, function names, comments and global variables (w/wo demangling)

* Synchronization modes
    * On demand
    * On rename (update on-the-fly)
* Supports image base-independent synchronization

## 2. Dynamic dumping of debugged process memory regions
It can be useful in the following cases:

* When debugged process has extracted/temporary/injected module which doesn't appear in modules list
* When it doesn't have a valid PE header
* When it have corrupted import table, etc.

## 3. Python scripting

We support the following list of debug backends for now:

* [OllyDbg 1.10](http://www.ollydbg.de/), DeFixed 1.10 (FOFF's team mod)
* [OllyDbg 2.01](http://www.ollydbg.de/)
* [x64dbg](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg) (x32, x64) 

Overview
========

Labeless is a plugin system for **dynamic, seamless and realtime synchronization between IDA Database and debug backend**.
It consists of two parts: IDA plugin and debug backend's plugin.

Labeless significantly reduces time that researcher spends on transferring already reversed/documented code information from IDA (static) to debugger (dynamic). It saves time, preventing from doing the same job twice. Also, you can document and add data to the IDB on the fly and your changes will be automatically propagated to debug backend, even if you will restart the virtual machine or instance of debug backend will crash. So, you will never lose your research.

This solution is highly upgradable. You can implement any helper scripts in Python on debug backend's side and then just call them from IDA with one line of code, parsing the results and automatically propagating changes to IDB.

**We can take that memory region** and put it in the IDB, fixing imports 'on-the-fly', using debug backend's functionality. No more need in ImpRec or BinScylla, searching for the regions in memory that contain the real IAT, because we get that information dynamically from the debugged process itself.

As a result we have a lot of memory regions that may represent even different modules (if the unpacking process if multistage) with valid references between them, which gives us a possibility to build a full control flow graph of the executable. Basically, we will end up with one big IDB, containing all the info on the specific case.

Installation
============
## Usage of precompiled binaries (release version) 
### Debug-backend setup:
If you want to use both x86 and x86_64 targets, then you should do the following steps for each python distro.

* Set up Python 2.7 (x86/x86_64)
* Copy `deploy` direcotry to target machine, where you want to use a debugger backend
* Set up protobuf 2.6.1 using the following commands:

```bat
cd c:\deploy
c:\Python27\python.exe setup_protobuf.py
```
* Install "labeless" python module, there are two ways to archive that, the first one is to use PyPI in case you have an Internet connection on the debug machine:

```bat
pip install --upgrade labeless

```

In case you don't have an Internet connection, you could install prebuilt module from release archive:

```bat
cd c:\deploy
c:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install labeless-1.1.2.65-py2.py3-none-any.whl
```

**Note**: If you have already used Labeless before and you want to update it, don't forget to reinstall python module each time you have new release

* Configure your debugger backend: set up `plugins` directory

## Configuring of your IDA PRO:
Labeless supports **Windows** and **Linux** (starting from 6.9.5 version of) IDA PRO. Labeless handles only PE/AMD64 binaries. Labeless requires **IDAPython** plugin `python.[plw|p64|plx|plx64]` (it ships with IDA PRO, but make sure it works well).

There are plugins:
```
IDA[XX]\plugins\labeless_ida.plw - for IDA for Windows, handles 32-bit binaries (used with idaq)
IDA[XX]\plugins\labeless_ida.p64 - for IDA for Windows, handles 64-bit binaries (used with idaq64)
IDA[XX]\plugins\labeless_ida.plx - for IDA for Linux, handles 32-bit binaries (used with idaq)
IDA[XX]\plugins\labeless_ida.plx64 - for IDA for Linux, handles 64-bit binaries (used with idaq64)
```

Copy Labeless plugins to your IDA's `plugins` directory, for example `c:\IDA68\plugins`

* In case you have IDA for Windows, please, use `.plw`/`.p64` plugins.

* If you have IDA for Linux, please, use `.plx`/`.plx64` plugins. Also, copy `IDA[XX]/libprotobuf.so.9` to your IDA home directory (for example `/home/alex/ida695/`), it's an important library.

## Configuring of debug backends
### 1. OllyDbg 1.10
You may find prepared debugger in the following directory `OllyDbg110`. (Note!: Don't forget to set up debugger's `plugins` directory).

### 1.1 DeFixed 1.10 (FOFF's team mod)
Copy `DeFixed110\plugins\labeless_olly_foff.dll` to DeFixed `plugins` directory (Note!: Don't forget to set up debugger's `plugins` directory)

### 2. OllyDbg 2.01
You may find prepared debugger in the following directory `OllyDbg201`. (Note!: Don't forget to set up debugger's `plugins` directory).

### 3. x64dbg (x32,x64)
You may find prepared debugger in the following directory `x64dbg`.

# Checking if everything works
 * Start debug backend (debugger) and check for _Labeless_ item presence in the _Plugins_ menu. If there is any problem, then check Olly's log window for details. Open the log window and check for `LL: ok, binded at <IP>:<PORT>` message, its presence means that debug backend-side plugin is initialized successfully. Note: if you start many debuggers, you may see that the following message appears

![port_auto_select.png](docs/port_auto_select.png)

Also, you may see the firewall alert

![allow_firewall.png](docs/allow_firewall.png)

If you want to access the debug backend from another computer, you should allow the backend to listen by this dialog or manually.

 * Start working with existing IDA database or use `Labeless` -> `Load stub database...` from the menu
 * Open Labeless settings dialog using any of the following actions:
    * menu `Edit` -> `Plugins` -> `Labeless`
    * main menu `Labeless` -> `Settings...`
    * hotkey `Alt+Shift+E`
 * Enter **IP address** and **port** of the guest machine (where debug backend is set up), then click on '_Test connection'_ button
 * If IDA displays the message `Successfully connected!`, then configuration is done correctly.


## Development

* Set up Python 2.7 (x86/x86_64)
* protobuf 2.6.1
* Visual Studio 2010 + Qt 4.8.4 (built with "QT" namespace) - required by **IDA's 6.8** plugin (to proper use IDA's Qt). You can configure Qt by yourself with the following command:

`configure -platform win32-msvc2010 -shared -release -no-webkit -opensource -no-qt3support -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -opengl desktop  -nomake demos -nomake examples -nomake tools -no-script -no-scripttools -no-declarative -qtnamespace QT`

* Visual Studio 2015 + Qt 5.4.1 to build IDA's 6.9 and debug backend plugins. You should build Qt 5.4.1 from sources. Do the following steps to do that:
    * Download sources of Qt 5.4.1 from  [http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.4/5.4.1/single/](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.4/5.4.1/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.4.1.7z)
    * Check [this article](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-requirements.html) out to set up Qt 5 requirements
    * Check the [Hex blog](http://www.hexblog.com/?p=969) about compiling Qt 5.4.1, grab the patch and apply it on Qt5 root dir. Then compile Qt 5
    * Set up [Qt VS-Addin](http://download.qt.io/official_releases/vsaddin/qt-vs-addin-1.2.5.exe)


# How to use
 * If you want to enable synchronization of labels (names) and comments from IDA to Olly you should check '_Enable labels & comments sync_' in Labeless settings dialog in IDA. There is one required field called '_Remote module base_', which should be set to the current module base of the analyzed application. You can find out that information in the debugger
 * Select needed features, like _Demangle name_, _Local labels_, _Non-code names_
 * Select comments synchronization type:
    * \<Disabled\>
    * Non-repeatable
    * Repeatable
    * All

Repeatable - are comments, which IDA shows in any referenced place.

 * If you want to sync labels right now - press '_Sync now_' button. Labeless will sync all found names in your IDB with Olly. Settings dialog will be automatically closed, while saving all settings
 * Also, you may use `Labeless` -> `Sync labels now` from IDA's main menu
 * If you want to customize settings for IDADump engine, do it in the '_IDADump_' tab.
 * To save changed settings, click on '_Save & Close_'

# Things automatically performed in the background
 * If you enabled '_Enable labels & comments sync_' option, then Labeless will automatically synchronize all the data on any rename operation in IDA

# Troubleshooting
Issue with Python 2.7.11 is described [here](http://bugs.python.org/issue26998?), so avoid usage of this version. The latest stable supported version is 2.7.10.

* Q: Labeless for x64dbg x32 is works, but x64 doesn't. Why?
* A: Please, recheck that you have installed protobuf and 'labeless' module for Python x64
